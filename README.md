------------------------------------------------
make the robot manovrable by a joystick, connect it to a1 (VRy) and a2 (VRx)

you can make it turn with right and left on itself (VRx) and making it go forward, go backward (moving VRy up and down) and stop (move the lever to the opposite direction and let it go a moment later)
